- Programmed a rendering pipeline to perform acoustic rendering
- The aim was to simulate acoustics of reconstructed spaces, approximating their physical soundfields
- An acoustic renderer was built to to approximate reverb, using material recognition systems to attribute acoustic properties to reconstructed geometry.
