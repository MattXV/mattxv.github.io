- Developd material recognition system based on spatial mapping and scene understanding.

- The system applies to real-time platforms by inferring from framebuffers and projecting materials into a live virtual environment.

- Developed an alternative system that works directly on texture data by leveraging texture superpixels.

- The system trains on virtual environments reconstructed from real space.

- These methods allow automatic material recognition for acoustic rendering tasks.
