- Developed a binaural audio spatialiser using Head-Related Transfer Functions to create spatialisation effects in AR
- This is prototyped as a C/C++ native module for ARM64 UWP platforms
- The source code is available here: [DSP tools](https://github.com/MattXV/DSPToolbox)

- The spatialiser was tested by running a subjective study, where participants would test spatialisation effects
- The test produced some interesting results on the use of custom HRTFs and ray tracing in AR devices
